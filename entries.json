            "content": "I feel that my emotion always jeopardizes my performance in an interview. Even though I have prepared for the interview and even writing everything down, it is always not enough for an actual interview. The high level of anxiety always overwhelms me during the interview process. Interview is really a skill that is important. I am always unable to sleep before an official interview. My mom has said that I have been too serious for an interview and I should take it easy. I don't know how to take it easy. I understand that it is normal to be rejected and sometimes it depends on my luck/fate. But then my mind is just very negative and I keep thinking about the interviews. And I take very long to fall asleep nowadays because I always think about interview so much. How to succeed in an interview? Everyday thinking of this and everyday reading of this. I'm so sick of interview. All those emotional rollercoaster. I'm so tired. I'm very tired. Everyday is about interview and job application. \nI really want to have a day that I can rest and stop thinking about interview. Interview is like a curse to me. Sometimes I really want to go back to my grandma's house at Malaysia and accompany her for the rest of my life. My childhood at Malaysia was very happy. I could just spend one whole day reading books or play with my cousins. Now I couldn't even have the peace of mind to read a book. I have a whole list of books I wanted to read, but I couldn't even focus on reading them. I want to go home."
